# Ready Tensor Agentic AI Certification â€“ Week 6

Welcome to **Week 6** of the [Agentic AI Developer Certification Program](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/HrJ0xWtLzLNt) by Ready Tensor!

[Last week](https://github.com/readytensor/rt-agentic-ai-cert-week5), you built your first **agentic systems** â€” intelligent assistants powered by LangGraph, memory, tools, and observability. This week, we take things further by shifting from **individual agents** to **multi-agent systems** that collaborate, specialize, and even debate.

---

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

Week 6 is all about **system architecture** â€” designing agentic systems composed of multiple, modular agents that interact meaningfully and reliably. Youâ€™ll go from developer to **agent system designer**.

By the end of the week, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Design and implement multi-agent workflows
- Assign agent roles and manage collaboration boundaries
- Use LangGraph to orchestrate agent communication and shared memory
- Resolve tool conflicts and handle unreliable agent behavior
- Connect agents to external systems via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- Architect resilient and modular systems ready for scale

## ðŸ“š Lessons in This Repository

### Lesson 1 â€“ Building Blocks of Multi-Agent Systems

Understand the key components and patterns of agentic system design. Learn how agent teams are structured and what differentiates a multi-agent system from a single, complex agent.

### Lesson 2a â€“ Defining the Agentic Authoring Assistant

Introduce the Week 6 project: an Agentic Authoring Assistant. Define its overall goals and scope down to the tag extraction sub-project, setting the stage for implementation.

### Lesson 2b â€“ Building the Tag Extraction System

Implement the tag extraction component using LangGraph. Combine traditional logic, ML models, and LLM reasoning â€” and explore when (and whether) agents are actually needed.

### Lesson 3 â€“ Designing Roles and Responsibilities

Explore how to define clear agent responsibilities and boundaries to reduce redundancy, improve clarity, and enable specialization in your systems.

### Lesson 4 â€“ Multi-Agent Research Assistant (Mini-Project)

Build a collaborative agentic system composed of three or more agents working together to explore, analyze, and summarize research content.

### Lesson 5 â€“ Communication via MCP (Model Context Protocol)

Learn how agents can talk to external systems and each other over a shared protocol. See how to structure flexible, interoperable agent interfaces.

### Lesson 6 â€“ Real-World Issues: Debugging, Conflicts, and Resilience

Study common pitfalls in multi-agent designs: tool contention, inconsistent outputs, communication failures â€” and how to design systems that recover gracefully.

### Lesson 7 â€“ Production-Aware Multi-Agent System (Capstone Example)

Walk through a full-featured multi-agent application with robust design patterns, fallback behaviors, and observability baked in â€” the kind of architecture youâ€™ll aim for in your Week 8 project.

## ðŸš€ Coming Soon: Code & Exercises

Code examples, LangGraph scripts, and debugging utilities will be added soon to help you:

- Implement and visualize multi-agent graphs
- Define shared and isolated memory scopes
- Manage inter-agent messaging and task delegation
- Simulate collaboration and disagreement between agents

Stay tuned â€” this repo will be updated as the week progresses.
