# Ready Tensor Agentic AI Certification â€“ Week 6

Welcome to **Week 6** of the [Agentic AI Developer Certification Program](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/HrJ0xWtLzLNt) by Ready Tensor!

[Last week](https://github.com/readytensor/rt-agentic-ai-cert-week5), you built your first **agentic systems** â€” intelligent assistants powered by LangGraph, memory, tools, and observability. This week, we take things further by shifting from **individual agents** to **multi-agent systems** that collaborate, specialize, and even debate.

---

## ðŸ§  What You'll Learn

Week 6 is all about **system architecture** â€” designing agentic systems composed of multiple, modular agents that interact meaningfully and reliably. Youâ€™ll go from developer to **agent system designer**.

By the end of the week, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Design and implement multi-agent workflows
- Assign agent roles and manage collaboration boundaries
- Use LangGraph to orchestrate agent communication and shared memory
- Resolve tool conflicts and handle unreliable agent behavior
- Connect agents to external systems via **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- Architect resilient and modular systems ready for scale

## ðŸ“š Lessons in This Repository

### Lesson 1 â€“ [Building Blocks of Multi-Agent Systems](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/architecting-intelligence-design-patterns-for-multi-agent-ai-systems-aaidc-week6-lesson-1-Sp2HOfRpH4Fl)

Understand the key components and patterns of agentic system design. Learn how agent teams are structured and what differentiates a multi-agent system from a single, complex agent.

### Lesson 2a â€“ [Defining the Agentic Authoring Assistant](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/from-idea-to-architecture-defining-our-agentic-authoring-assistant-aaidc-week6-lesson-2-Gq1xQ27DmJ56)

Introduce the Week 6 project: an Agentic Authoring Assistant. Define its overall goals and scope down to the tag extraction sub-project, setting the stage for implementation.

### Lesson 2b â€“ [Building the Tag Extraction System](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/from-architecture-to-implementation-building-the-tag-extraction-system-aaidc-week6-lesson-2b-D3vJsJh1500g)

Implement the tag extraction component using LangGraph. Combine traditional logic, ML models, and LLM reasoning â€” and explore when (and whether) agents are actually needed.

### Lesson 3a â€“ [Designing Roles and Responsibilities](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/building-the-dream-team-designing-the-right-agents-for-the-job-aaidc-week6-lesson-3a-qtRz3uuXGx5Y)

Explore how to define clear agent responsibilities and boundaries to reduce redundancy, improve clarity, and enable specialization in your systems.

### Lesson 3b â€“ [Architectural Patterns for Multi-Agent Systems](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/orchestrating-intelligence-designing-agentic-systems-that-actually-work-aaidc-week6-lesson-3b-redklSjefHNo)

Learn how to design agentic systems that produce coherent, coordinated outputs. Explore different architectural approaches â€” from simple sequential chains to sophisticated coordinated systems â€” and understand the trade-offs between complexity, quality, and efficiency.

### Lesson 4a â€“ [Introduction to MCP](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/mcp-a-standard-way-for-ai-to-use-external-tools-aaidc-week6-lecture-4a-LAeGUSWv4dKb)

Discover MCP (Model Context Protocol) â€” the universal standard that's doing for AI what HTTP did for the web. Learn how MCP solves integration chaos, provides built-in security, and enables AI agents to seamlessly connect with external tools and data sources through a standardized protocol.

### Lesson 4b â€“ [MCP In Action](https://app.readytensor.ai/publications/mcp-in-action-connecting-and-creating-real-ai-integrations-aaidc-week6-lesson-4b-35v0wzEbKZBo)

Go from MCP theory to practice. Learn how to connect your AI to existing MCP servers (like GitHub, file systems, and databases) and build your own custom MCP server from scratch. Includes hands-on code walkthroughs and real-world integration examples.

## ðŸš€ Coming Soon: Code & Exercises

Code examples, LangGraph scripts, and debugging utilities will be added soon to help you:

- Implement and visualize multi-agent graphs
- Define shared and isolated memory scopes
- Manage inter-agent messaging and task delegation
- Simulate collaboration and disagreement between agents

Stay tuned â€” this repo will be updated as the week progresses.
